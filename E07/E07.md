Logistic Regression would be the appropriate ML paradigmn

# 2.
The one-vs-all approach would be the best way to process this data using logistic Regression

Running for setosa, versicolor, and virginica produced varying results. The setosa model has a perfect apparent error rate of 0%. Versicolor had the worst model with an error rate of 33%. Virginica wasn't as good as setosa, but still acceptable with an error rate of 15%.

These error rates makes sense based on the graphs because versicolor and virginia features are interspersed while setosa clearly stands by itself.

I was able to slightly improve the apparent error rate by using a larger alpha value of `.1`. With this, the versicolor error rate decreased to 26% and the virginica 4%. The setosa remained at 0%.
