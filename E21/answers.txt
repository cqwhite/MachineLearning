What preparations are needed to make the data useable?
Thanks to our implementation, nothing.

What decisions will need to be made regarding the GA configuration? In other words, what are the parameters that will affect overall GA performance?
Population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, and max generations will be most useful to us.
Because the length of each chromosome is quite long (30), my intuition tells me that a larger population size will be beneficial.

What configuration provided the best performance as a % of optimal tour?
popSize=50000, mutRate=0.1, crossRate=0.4, maxGens=115
Most reliably trended toward at least 95% fitness.

What appears to be your best tour?
My best run had a fitness percentage of 99.9%.

What is the number of possible tours that would have to be tested to find the brute force solution?
8.841762e+30 (29 factorial)
